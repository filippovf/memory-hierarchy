# memory-hierarchy

A bash shell script to show information about memory hierarchy. Designed to illustrate undergraduate classes in operating systems and computer architecture and organization.

It was tested on Ubuntu Linux LTS from 16.04 to 20.04, as well as Ubuntu at Windows Subsystem for Linux. But it should work on any Linux distribution!

To run the script just download the file, make it executable (chmod +x memhier) and then run:

./memhier
